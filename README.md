# The Proxy Agent Demo

<p align="center">
  <strong>A Stateful, Tool-Enabled Demonstration Powered by the Proxy Structuring Engine</strong>
</p>

## Overview

The Proxy Agent Demo showcases a powerful, structured implementation built on top of the [Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-structuring-engine). It provides an illustrative example for creating and deploying intelligent agentic systems with tool-use capabilities, state awareness, and structured output.

This framework leverages PSE's state machine architecture to enable reliable, deterministic agent behavior while maintaining the creative power of large language models. It's designed for both performance and flexibility, allowing you to create agents that can:

- Execute complex, multi-step tasks
- Utilize external tools and APIs
- Maintain context and state across interactions
- Generate reliably structured responses
- Execute code (Python and Bash) when necessary

## Features

- **State Machine Architecture**: Built on PSE's stateful control system to ensure reliable, deterministic behavior
- **Tool Integration**: Easy-to-use system for adding custom tools and capabilities
- **Multiple Interface Options**: CLI interface included with extensible design
- **Local LLM Support**: Optimized for running with local MLX models
- **Voice Capabilities**: Optional voice integration with text-to-speech responses
