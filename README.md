# The Proxy Base Agent (PBA)

<p align="center">
  <strong>A Stateful, Tool-Enabled Agent Powered by the Proxy Structuring Engine</strong>
</p>

## Overview

The Proxy Base Agent showcases a powerful, structured implementation built on top of the [Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE)](https://github.com/TheProxyCompany/proxy-structuring-engine).

The PBA leverages a state machine architecture to enable reliable, deterministic agent behavior while maintaining the creative power of large language models.

It's designed for both performance and flexibility, allowing you to create agents that can:

- Execute complex, multi-step tasks
- Utilize external tools and APIs
- Maintain context and state across interactions
